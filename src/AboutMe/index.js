        <p>Hello, I'm Oliver Martin. Formerly known as Genesis. I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. My coding journey started in my late teenage years when MySpace and Tumblr was at its peak. I wondered how everything worked, so I tinkered with code until I could figure out how to personalize my pages. I enjoyed putting the pieces together. After the popularity of those websites died, I stopped coding. I found out that careers existed out of what I was doing, so I made the switch.</p>
          
        <p>Besides all of that, I love art in general. I started my childhood with drawing, then I got inspired in my early teens from friends to pick up the guitar, sing, and make music. In my late teens, I picked up a little bit of dance, and also fell in love with Photography. </p>
